This github repository contains all of the code written for Joseph Jennings' Senior 
Design Project.

The code contained in the directory 'OpenCL' contains all of the OpenCL code written
in C++ and the projects within that directory are divided into two subdirectories MacOSX and Linux.
The source code found within those directories are listed as follows:


MacOSX:

1. ArraySum: Sums two two dimensional arrays of floats.

2. FlopsTestGPU: Used to test the performance of running a large computation on the GPU as 
compared to the CPU.  When this code is run, it is important to note that the timing is very 
oscillatory, alternating between two values after each time it is run. 
The reason for this has yet to be discovered.
	
3. FlopsTestCPU: Not OpenCL code. Just C++ was used to test the performance of a large 
computation on the CPU. Used to compare performance against the program "flopsTestGPU" which 
is run on the GPU. It is important to note that when the number of lines of 
the array is change from 150 to 155 a drastic change in the performance occurs.

4. FlopsTestGPULoop: Performs the same function as "flopsTestGPU" only now instead of hardcoding
each computation, a for loop was written within the .cl file.

5. FlopsTestCPULoop: Performs the same function as "flopsTestCPU" only now instead of hardcoding
each computation, a for loop was written within the they array summation loops.

6. perfscripts: Shell Scripts written in order to test the performance of the code within
the OpenCL directory.

7. perflogs: Log files written in order to record the performance tests of the code within
the OpenCL directory. The perflogs directory is divided into subdirectories which contain
the log files for the different programs within the the OpenCL directory.

Linux:

1. ArraySum: Sums two two dimensional arrays of floats.

2. FlopsTestGPULoop: The equivalent to 'FlopsTestGPULoop' for MacOSX but this runs for a Linux based OS.

3. FlopsTestCPULoop: The equivalent to 'FlopsTestCPULoop' for MacOSX but this runs for a Linux based OS.

4. perfscripts: Performance scripts used to test the execution performance of the CPU and GPU code.

5. perflogs: Log files written in order to record the performance tests of the code within
the OpenCL directory. The perflogs directory is divided into subdirectories which contain
the log files for the different programs within the the OpenCL directory.



The code contained in the directory 'JOCL' contains all of the OpenCL code written in
Java and the project within that directory are:

1. ArraySum: Sums two two dimensional arrays of floats.

2. FlopsTestGPULoop: Used to test the performance of summing arrays on the GPU as compared
to the CPU.

3. FlopsTestCPULoop: Used to test compare against the peformance of summing arrays on the GPU.

4. perfscripts: Shell scripts used to run the JOCL code and test its performance.

5. perflogs: Logs that capture the results of the tests run by the performance scripts.
This directory is split into sub-directories that organize the logs according to which JOCL
program is being tested.


More projects/source code are to be added in the future...
