This github repository contains all of the code written for Joseph Jennings' Senior 
Design Project.

The code contained in the directory 'OpenCL' contains all of the OpenCL code written
in C++ and the projects within that directory are:

	1. arraySum: Sums two two dimensional arrays of floats.
	2. flopsTestGPU: Used to test the performance of running a large computation on the GPU as compared to the CPU.
	3. flopsTestCPU: Not OpenCL code. Just C++ used to test the performance of a large computation on the CPU. Used to compare
					 performance against the program "flopsTestGPU" which is run on the GPU.

The code contained in the directory 'JOCL' contains all of the OpenCL code written in
Java and the project within that directory are:

	1. arraySum: Sums two two dimensional arrays of floats.

More projects are to be added in the future.
