 * A timer that works like a stopwatch. A stopwatch can be started and

 * Stopwatch time is elapsed (wall-clock) time, not process or CPU time. 
 * Stopwatch time resolution is one nanosecond. In other words, a 
 * stopwatch cannot measure a time difference less than one nanosecond.
 * On the other hand, the granularity of the stopwatch depends on the
 * underlying operating system and may be larger.
