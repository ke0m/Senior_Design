/**
 * An implementation of the LSQR algorithm of Paige and Saunders.
 * Let A denote a sparse matrix with m rows and n columns, let b denote
 * a column vector with m rows, and let damp denote a scalar. This solver 
 * iteratively computes a solution x to one of the following problems:
 * <pre><code>
 * (1) unsymmetric equations -- A*x = b
 * (2) linear least squares  -- A*x = b, in the least-squares sense
 * (3) damped least squares  -- Abar*x = bbar, in the least-squares sense,
 *     where   Abar = | A      |  and  bbar = |b| 
 *                    | damp*I |              |0|
 * </code></pre>
 * This solver does not require that the elements of the matrix A be 
 * specified explicitly. Rather, it requires only multiplication by A 
 * and its transpose A'. Specifically, when solving any of the three 
 * problems listed above, the user must provide an abstract linear 
 * operator A that updates vectors x and y via y = y+A*x and x = x+A'*y.
 * The column vector x has n rows; the column vector y has m rows.
 * <p>
 * The solver is iterative, and iterations typically end before any of the 
 * problems listed above are solved exactly. For example, iterations may
 * end when errors in the residual r = A*x - b are less than the estimated 
 * error in the elements of the column vector b. When constructing a solver, 
 * the user must specify the following parameters:
 * <dl>
 * <dt>atol</dt>
 * <dd>estimate of relative error in elements of the matrix A.</dd>
 * <dt>btol</dt>
 * <dd>estimate of relative error in the right-hand-side vector b.</dd>
 * <dt>ctol</dt>
 * <dd>estimate of the reciprocal of the condition number of matrix Abar.</dd>
 * <dt>maxi</dt>
 * <dd>maximum number of iterations to perform.</dd>
 * </dl>
 * For example, if b is accurate to about six digits, then set btol = 1.0e-6.
 * <p>
 * The number of iterations required to achieve a certain accuracy depends
 * strongly on the scaling of the problem. For example, in problem (1) above
 * the solution is unaltered by row scaling. If a row of A is very small or
 * large compared to the other rows of A, then the small or large row of A
 * should be scaled up or down.
 * <p>
 * In problems 1 and 2, the solution x is easily recovered following column
 * scaling. Unless better information is available, and where feasible, the 
 * non-zero columns of A should be scaled so that they all have the same
 * Euclidean norm.
 * <p>
 * In problem 3, there is no freedom to scale if damp is nonzero. However,
 * the value of damp should be assigned only after scaling A appropriately.
 * The parameter damp exists to help regularize ill-conditioned systems, by
 * preventing the true solution from being very large.
 * <p>
 * Adapted from Paige, C.C, and Saunders, M.A., 1982, Algorithm 583,
 * Collected algorithms of the ACM. Any differences here are likely 
 * errors in programming.
