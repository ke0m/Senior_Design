/**
 * Tensor-guided blended neighbor gridding in 3D.
 * Gridding is interpolation of a set of known sample values on a 
 * uniformly sampled grid. Here the interpolation is performed by 
 * a two-step process described by Hale (2009).
 * <p>
 * The first step is to compute for all samples the distance to the 
 * nearest known sample and the value of that known sample. This first
 * step produces a distance map and a nearest-neighbor interpolant.
 * <p>
 * The second step is to blend (smooth) the nearest-neighbor interpolant,
 * where the extent of smoothing varies spatially and is proportional to 
 * distances in the distance map.
 * <p>
 * In tensor-guided gridding, we replace distance with time. Time is a
 * simple term for non-Euclidean distance measured in a metric-tensor
 * field. So "nearest" now means nearest in time. In the first step we 
 * compute a time map by solving an eikonal equation with coefficients 
 * that may be both anisotropic and spatially varying. In the second 
 * step, we blend the nearest-neighbor interpolant with an anisotropic 
 * and spatially varying smoothing filter.
 * <p>
 * The default tensor field is homogeneous and isotropic. In this
 * special case, time is equivalent to distance, and tensor-guided
 * gridding is similar to gridding with Sibson's natural neighbor 
 * interpolant.
 * <p>
